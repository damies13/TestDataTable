# TestDataTable Library for RobotFramework

Using TestDataTable with RobotFramework is very easy, actually RobotFramework is used for testing every feature of TestDataTable.

You have 2 options:
1. Roll your own code, you can use using the existing RobotFramework libraries, the TestDataTable Regression tests might be helpful in doing this:
	[REST Library](../Regression_Tests/TestDataTable-API_REST.robot)
	[Requests Library](../Regression_Tests/TestDataTable-API_requests.robot)

2. Use the TDT Library provided here.

To use the TDT Library, download [TDT.py](./TDT.py) and then use the examples in [TDTClient.robot](./TDTClient.robot) for how to use this Library.
